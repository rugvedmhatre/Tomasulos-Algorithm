# Tomasulos-Algorithm
A simulator for Tomasulo's algorithm - an instruction scheduling approach facilitating out-of-order (OOO) execution and parallelization across functional units. The simulator aims to accurately model Tomasulo's algorithm, enabling users to analyze instruction execution dynamics, and test scenarios in computer architecture.
